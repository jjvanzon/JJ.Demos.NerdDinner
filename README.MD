NerdDinner
==========

*Author: Jan-Joost van Zon*

Introduction
------------

This is my take on the NerdDinner tutorial from Microsoft

(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/nerddinner/).

I had done the tutorial before and here I did it again, to get reaquainted with MVC, after not having used it for years. I did give it my own spin, changing the patterns to my liking, compared to what the original code of the tutorial said. I did stop at one point in the tutorial. Maybe at adding map functionality, that did had not much to do with MVC itself.

It is a Visual Studio 2010 C# project.

Prerequisites
-------------
To use the code you need to install:
* Microsoft Visual Studio Web Developer 2010 Express
* Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Management Objects (SharedManagementObjects.msi)
* Microsoft SQL Server System CLR Types (SQLSysClrTypes.msi)
